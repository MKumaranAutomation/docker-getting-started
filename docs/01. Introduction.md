## Docker - Linux Mode

In this video, we are going to look at basic `docker commands`

I am not going to walk through the installation process, as it is fairly straight forward  experience to download & install docker desktop

Although, I would just recommend to stay with the `Linux` mode of Docker

The Winodws mode is available for the `Legacy .NET Framework` applications

To demonstrate this, if you visit `hub.docker.com` & try finding a `Windows based Image`, it'll be not less than atleast 4 GB

As the saying goes, `you need to walk, before you run`, I strongly suggest to stay with the `linux mode` until you get comfortable, since that is where docker was originally built for
