# Docker - Getting Started

## Introduction

Hello & welcome to my course on `Docker - Getting Started`

This is a series of videos to help get up and running with CI / CD technologies such as

1. Docker
2. Jenkins
3. PowerShell
4. Kubernetes

## Dockerfile

In our previous video, we saw how to `Containerize an API`

But it was laborous, as we have to perform a series of steps manually, like

1. Pulling a docker image into local
2. Building the solution & publishing the artifacts
3. Creating & running a docker container
4. Inside the docker container, fire up `dotnet` command to run the application

Now, I want to be absolutely clear. All these steps are required. We are not going to by-pass any of these steps.

It is just not convenient to type all these commands in sequence on the CLI

Wouldn't it be better if I could declare these sequence in a text file & just run 1 command to perform all of these?

That's exactly what `Dockerfile` does

I have a simple Dockerfile with just 4 lines of code in it

```sh
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1

WORKDIR /app
COPY ./artifacts .

ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "KayakoToolsApi.dll" ]

```

## Building an Image

To build an image, I need to use `docker build` command

```sh
docker build -t ja-cs .
```

---

## Running the API

To run the application, you can use the regular command

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 ja-cs
```

---

## Materials

All the commands & descriptions are available as `notebooks`
The `Dockerfile` can be found in the same branch of `ja-cs` for further reference

`Happy Coding`
